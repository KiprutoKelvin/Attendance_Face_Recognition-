# Face Recognition Based Smart Attendance System

This project implements a smart attendance system using face recognition. It leverages Python, machine learning, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to automate attendance tracking. Attendance data is stored in CSV files and visualized in real-time through a Streamlit web application.

## Introduction

Traditional attendance systems are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This project aims to address these limitations by developing an automated attendance system using face recognition.  The system captures images from a webcam, detects and recognizes faces, and records attendance with timestamps.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition:**  Uses KNN to accurately identify individuals from webcam feed.
- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Automatically marks attendance upon successful face recognition.
- **CSV Data Storage:** Stores attendance records in CSV files for easy access and analysis.
- **Streamlit Web Application:** Provides a user-friendly interface to view and manage attendance in real-time.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple setup and intuitive interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KiprutoKelvin/Attendance_Face_Recognition-.git
